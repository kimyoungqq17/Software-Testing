## API Testing Plan

The Pet Clinic application is a small project which is built using an old MVC architecture (server side rendering). Since the application is small, it is easy to understand the different controller functions jobs and expected output. As such, the coverage goal, in terms of API classes, will be 90%. It was decided that the API test suite would put most of its attention on the total coverage goal.

### Testing Strategy

The testing strategy for the API testing will be to put emphasis on traversing the different paths (coverage) of each controller function. The reason being that while they are both intricately connected, it is a better practice to test validation mechanisms on their own. This reduces the complexity of different test suite (2 more simple rather than 1 big) and speeds up development.

### Coverage Goal

The coverage goal for the API testing was set to 90% in terms of API classes. This percentage was chosen because it is trivial to cover every single path since the application is rather small. It was previously decided to choose 100% as a goal, but it was later changed for 90% because even if the API currently looks simple, it still has a structure which no member of our team has previously encountered, thus we are expecting to hit road blocks which might prevent us from reaching 100%. Please note that when we refer to coverage goal, we will always be referring to statement coverage.

### Testing Tools

The API testing will be done using MockMvc (API to call endpoints and assert their response). 
A good example of MockMvc is the following:<br />
![mockMvcSample](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/wiki_images/api_images/mockMvcSample.png)<br/>
We make a call to an endpoint and we then assert the output. Some model objects cannot be created with API endpoints. It is the case for Vet objects and for PetType objects. Because of this, it was decided that for some controller, instead of using the entire application context, we may only using the controller context and mock the needed repositories with Mockito. Alternatively, a special database for testing only may be created. In summary, MockMvc will be the preferred tool for testing, but if it falls short of what it needed for some test cases, Mockito or a custom database will be used. 

<br />

In the multiple controller test table, "saving" is mentionned. Please note that we consider a save "sucessful" whenever we traverse the save instruction in the code. In other words, we do not validate that the save was done, but if we go over a save instruction we assume that it was successful.

### VetControllerTest
Testing class [VetControllerTests](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/controller/VetControllerTests.java) <br/>
Tested controller [VetController](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/controller/VetController.java)
| Test Name  | Status (Pass/Fail/Error) | Goal | Input | Expected Outcome| Expected Code |
| ------------- |-|-|-|-|-|
| testShowVetListHtmlCheckView | F | Validate that the vet list correctly shows all vets |  | The request is successful and the correct vets are in the model |200|
| testShowResourcesVetList | P | Validate that the correct list of all vets is returned | | A list containing all vets |200|
| testShowEmptyResourcesVetList | P | Validate that if there are no vets, an empty list will be returned (not null) | | An empty list | 200|

<br/>

Since there exists no request to create a vet and that we were prohibited to add code to the application, the vets were mocked using mockito. Although not ideal, this solution was chosen over creating a custom database for testing. The reasons were simple: 

- If we talk about correctness of testing, then mocking the repository does not affect the testing. This is because we are already assuming that the other layers of the application work correctly.
- If we think about software life cycle, it is much easier to ease the development as well as subsequent additions to the software when it is kept as simple as possible. Using a custom database for the tests would increase the complexity of the test as all the inputs would not be accessible in a single place.

In other words, mocking was a better choice as it keeps the correctness of our tests while also making the test suite (and by extension the application) much simplier than if a database was used. Please note that we do admit that it is better to not mock at all when it is easily possible.

The crash controller test is trivial enough that nothing needs to be said about it except about the handling of the exception. The thrown exception is a Runtime Exception. This is not optimal since this is not an exception that is easy to handle from the front end because of the long stack trace associated with it. Throwing a Http exception would be more meaningful and easier to deal with from the frontend. For example, the application could throw an exception similar to: `throw new ResponseStatusException(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST, "Old and new password cannot be null");`. The message of the request would then only include the wanted message rather than a long stack trace that the user does not care about. The coverage is 100% but it is a worthless indicator because of the simplicity of the test class.

|testInitUpdateFormNonExistentPet|petController|error (spring exception caused by a null value which tried to be inserted in the model)|To validate that an inexistent pet id cannot be used to update a form|Id of inexistent pet|Graceful abortion of the form creation|4xx|
|testShowOwnerWithNonExistentOwner|ownerController|error (nullPointer)|To validate that an inexistent owner cannot be shown|Id of inexistent owner|Graceful abortion of the request|4xx|
|testInitUpdateOwnerFormNonExistentOwner|ownerController|error (illegalArgument)|To validate that an inexistent owner cannot be used to update an owner form|Id of inexistent owner|Graceful abortion of the request|4xx|
|testInitNewVisitFormNonExistentPetId|visitController|error (nullArgument)|To validate that an inexistent pet cannot be used to create a new visit form|Id of inexistent pet|Graceful abortion of the request|4xx|
|testShowVetListHtmlCheckView|vetController|failure (assertion failed)|To validate that the model contains a list of vets with the right vets||Model contains the list of vets|200|

<br/>
The first 5 tests are all related to the same issue. The controller is retrieving data from the repository (e.g. `repo.findById(inexistentId)`) and is doing operations on the retrieved object without checking for a null value. These errors are extremely severe, first because a null check would easily prevent them and second because it is important to make null checks to provide useful feedback to the view of the application. Because these errors are not checked for, the user cannot know that the id he provided is invalid. He may think that there is a problem with the server rather than his request.

<br/>
The last error has to do with the way the Vets class (Notice the "s", we do mean Vets and not Vet) is built. It has a field named "vets", but that field does not have getters and setters. In the assertion, it checks for a property name "vets" (java bean, a field with getters and setters) to compare its items with the expected items. Since the "vets" field is missing a getter and a setter, the assertion cannot find it. This makes the test fail. It could be argued that we do not need to check the content of the model and that the test is too precise. For that reason, we will say that this assertion failure is a minor issue, as the request does complete normally and returns the appropriate http code. 
<br/>

## Integration of mocking technology

In the end, it was decided that the minimal amount of mocking technology would be used. That is, MockMvc would be use as the sole mocking technology wherever possible. When MockMvc could not accomplish what was wanted by itself, we would also use Mockito to mock the `findByX` functions of repositories (this was only done for the VetControllerTest. More information about this was already given below the VetControllerTest table). 

Few things needs to be said about the integration of MockMvc as it is straight forward, but below is an explanation of the implementation of different mocking technologies that, in the end, were discarded.
<br/>

The API testing was done 2 times in total. The second time was done using the strategy explained above, but the first time it was done by using validation mocks and construction mocks with MockMvc. The original plan was always to only use MockMvc, but because of the usual architecture of the application we thought that only Spring was in charge of providing parameters to the controller function (the parameters were not annotated with `@requestParam` or the likes like we are used to). This was a misunderstanding and when we learned that we could still provide parameters to the controller functions like it was taught to us, we redid the entire API testing using only MockMvc. It was important to redo the entire API because only using the API would allow us to find more bugs.
<br/>

Using validation and construction testing means the following: Spring generates a validator to validate the parameters annotated with `@valid`. By mocking the validator, we ensured that the validator would validate or invalidate whatever we wanted to be accepted or refused. This would have allowed us to achieve our coverage goal, but it is an incorrect testing method as it defeats the purpose of testing the functions for valid and invalid inputs. We then decided to instead use contruction mocks to create the tests. Construction mocks refers to mock any instance of a class from the constructor. This would allow us to control every instance of a class created by Spring when it tried to supply the functions with parameters. This is better than the validation mock since we can also verify valid and invalid inputs, but it is still not optimal since we are changing the object that Spring is supposed to create and are thus changing the normal behavior of the application. 
<br/>

Note that construction mocks definitively better than validation mocks and the only reason why we used validation mocks for some controllers was because of configuration issues which prevented us from using the Mockito-Inline dependency (the normal Mockito dependency, Mockito-Core, does not support construction mocking).

<br/>

The key takeaway is that MockMvc is the best way to test API components of an application, but that it is possible to do it using different methods, even if the correctness of the testing is lower.


## Coverage

The achieved coverage from API classes (controller) was 100%. Most controller tests also achieve 100% coverage on their tested controller class when ran by themselves like shown in the pictures (OwnerControllerTest is the only one not at 100%. It has 93%). Considering that our API testing technique focused on going through the most path possible and that the application is rather small, this coverage result is, while not small, to be expected. As concluding words, we can say that the application is robust and that the `@valid` correctly prevent invalid inputs, but that it also has vulnerabilities linked to nullPointer exceptions because of a lack of null checks.

![totalCoverage](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/wiki_images/api_images/coverageTotal.png) <br/>

## Application of Testing Technique

In this report, it was mentioned multiple times that achieving a high coverage was the main goal of the application. To be more precise, this was a white-box testing approach. We learned in class that white-box testing was mainly used for unit testing, but previous internship experience taught us that white box testing was often used when an API was simple or when a very high coverage was needed for specific reasons. The idea is that black-box testing is good when you cannot easily understand the inner workings of the code, but when it is possible to understand the code, such as with this small application, or when you absolutely need to understand every details, such as for a critical system, than it is sometimes preferred to use white-box testing for the sake of achieving a higher coverage goal. Like said previously, white-box testing was chosen to achieve a high coverage goal. It is better to use this type of testing for an application that is small because it offers a better guarantee for future updates or improvements to the application. Additionally, for an application with an old structure such as this one, we believed that white-box testing was more appropriate for the simple reason that we do not have the necessary knowledge about Spring to correctly make use of black-box testing. What is meant by that is that Spring handles many things for the programmer and it is even more true for this application as it makes use of model parameters. We would then struggle to correctly test the different endpoints without knowing in what way Spring was interacting with our inputs. In summary, white-box testing was chosen because a higher coverage is more important for a small application, but also because it is more appropriate when you are not used to the technology or structure that you are working with.

<br/>
Here is an example of code and the flow graph that was made to create the appropriate tests. <br/>

![complexFunction](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/wiki_images/api_images/complexFunction.png) <br/>
In general making a flow chart was not necessary, but it was worthwhile for this function. The result was the following:
![simpleFlow](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/wiki_images/api_images/simpleFlow.png) <br/>

Then, the following tests were used to achieve a 100% coverage over that function.
- testProcessFindFormEmptyLastName
- testProcessFindFormNoResult
- testProcessFindFormOneResult
- testProcessFindFormMultipleResult
<br/>
The previous graph and code are and example of how the tests were built. There is no particular section of the API Test Suite which was made using white-box testing. The entire test suite was made with white-box testing and maximal coverage in mind. The controller test classes and the controller under test are available above each table of the report (except the table of failed cases, which includes tests from multiple files).
<br/>

***

With hindsight, while it was not a bad idea to use white box testing for the API, no definitive conclusion can be made for its efficacity. On the other hand, the implementation definitively was more intuitive then it would have been using black-box testing. This is because the application relied a lot on Spring to provide function parameters. Because of this, it can be said that it would have been hard to do black-box testing effectively. Another way to see this is that black-box testing is like putting input in a black-box and observing the output. Here, for certain inputs, Spring would "overwrite" our initial input and put its own instead. Because of this, there is no way to know whether an input was "valid" or was simply overwritten because it was deemed "invalid".
