## Plan 
As we are aware that unit tests are done by the developers themselves, it was necessary for us to familiarize ourselves with the application and the source code. Reading the documentation, we cloned the directory with Git, built it with Maven, and ran it with Java. When reading the source code, we switched it to debug mode under main/resources/application.properties. With logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG uncommented, we tested the features of the application. Using the debugger in Intellij, we were able to follow the log messages along with the source code. 


Once we have rudimentary understanding of the project, we ran static analysis tools to expedite writing Junit tests focusing on non trivial functions. We adjusted the pom.xml file and ran Sonarqube and Infer on the project. (view the reports [1](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/unit%20test%20for%20project.PNG), [2](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/unit%20test%20for%20project2.PNG), [3](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/unit%20test%20for%20project3.PNG)) 


After reading the reports, we started planning for writing unit tests. We isolated core functions that need to be tested thoroughly. We differentiated the setters and getters that do more than just set and get from the trivial setters and getters. However, since we were asked to write unit tests for the model and service classes only, and we strive to obtain as much coverage as possible, we aimed to cover all the paths for getters/setters with at least one success case and one fail case. Additionally, to be certain, for the functions that we know we have to test thoroughly from our analysis, we followed the following approach: we set the coverage goal, derived CFG from the source code, determined/sensitized paths to test, ran test cases, confirmed the output with the expected output, and finally checked the coverage with a test coverage tool. 

## Report

### Model/BaseEntity.java 
_(view the coverage [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/baseEntity.PNG))_

_(view the code [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/unitTests/model/BaseEntityTests.java))_


The class has one private field, and setter and getter for the field. We noticed that setters and getters for the class are trivial that we tested them under one test. The class constructor was tested as well. We instantiated an entity object that’s set as a global variable, and the entity is used with different field values as an input to the test cases. For each method, one success path with an expected test case and one failure path with a non expected test case were written.
The class has a function that checks if the ID of the object is null or not. It only has two paths. We set two cases that cover all the paths: an entity that is new that the id is null and an entity that’s not new that has an id.

### Model/NamedEntity.java
_(view the coverage [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/namedEntity.PNG))_

_(view the code [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/unitTests/model/NamedEntityTests.java))_


The class has one private field, and setter and getter for the field. We noticed that setters and getters for the class are trivial that we tested them under one test. The class constructor was tested as well. The class has a toString method that returns the name field for the object, which was tested.We instantiated the namedEntity object that’s set as a global variable, and the entity is used with different field values as an input to the test cases. For each method, one success path with an expected test case and one failure path with a non expected test case were written.

### Model/Owner.java 
_(view the coverage [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/owner.PNG))_

_(view the code [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/unitTests/model/OwnerTests.java))_


The class has four private fields, and a setter and getter for the fields. We noticed that setters and getters for the class are trivial that we tested them under one test. The class constructor was tested as well. We instantiated an owner object that’s set as a global variable, and the object is used with different field values as an input to the test functions. We repeatedly choose to have a limited number of global variables as we learnt in class that it’s better to avoid dependency. For each method, one success path with an expected test case and one failure path with a non expected test case were written. 

As for a setter and getter for PetInternal, we set the coverage goal and derived the control flow graph. (view the graph [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/101.PNG)) Since we expect the full coverage, we write test cases for each possible path. We test when the Set pet is equal to null by providing a newly created owner instance that does not yet have the set this.pet. We confirm the output matches our expected value. As for the other path, we confirm that the created owner instance has the set with a pet instance with a setter. We check the expected value and the output are the same. We run the code coverage tool, and see that our tests satisfy the coverage goal. 

We apply the same approach for the function addPet. (view the graph [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/102.PNG)) As for the path 1->2->3, we sensitize the input to be the pet that’s new. We purposely set the pet ID to be null and petsInternal set to be empty. Then we call getPets, if successful, petsInternal should add the pet. We check the size of petsInternal is indeed 1. We also confirm pet.getOwner() outputs our expected output. We run the code coverage tool, and see that our tests satisfy the coverage goal.

To test a function toString() efficiently, testing techniques we learnt in class were required.  Instead of testing each field one by one, we did the following: assertThat(owner.toString()).contains(input); input being the mentioned parameter, utilizing @ParametrizedTest

Another testing technique that’s been featured is @Nested. The  Owner class contains three getPets functions with different parameters. They are grouped together using @Nested because they use common objects and fields as their inputs. Outside @Nested, we instantiate pet objects and test the creation of pet objects that are adjusted with the proper field values. Inside @Nested, we write the test functions for getPets(), getPet(String name), getPet(String name, boolean ignoreNew). The function without parameters doesn’t have any conditional branch that deriving CFG for it isn’t necessary. A noticeable line in the function is PropertyComparator.sort(sortedPets). We test the sorting functionality with one success path and one failure path. The function getPet(String name) simply calls getPet(String name, false) that we again plainly test with one success path and one failure path. However, for the function getPet(String name, boolean ignoreNew), we set the coverage goal and derived the control flow graph. (view the graph [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/103.PNG)) We applied a multiple condition coverage and a loop coverage for the function. As for the loop coverage, we tested when there’s no pet in the set, when there’s only one pet in the set, and finally when there are two pets in the set. The function has two conditional branches. First branch has four combinations and the inner second branch has two combinations. Since we are doing multiple condition coverage, for the first branch we cover all four possibilities and for the second branch we test the two possibilities.

### Model/Person.java

_(view the code [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/unitTests/model/PersonTests.java))_


The class has two private fields, and setters and getters for the fields. The same testing logic applied to BaseEntity.java has been applied. 

### Model/Pet.java 
_(view the coverage [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/pet2.PNG))_

_(view the code [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/unitTests/model/PetTests.java))_


The class has four private fields, and setters and getters for the fields. For the first three, the same testing logic applied to BaseEntity.java has been applied. As for a setter and getter for visitInternal, we set the coverage goal and derived the control flow graph (view the graph [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/104.PNG)). We test each path(a path coverage) and confirm we see the expected output. Simultaneously we run the code coverage tool to verify that we covered every path. 
As the code coverage result indicates, we see that our test cases fail to cover all the instructions/branches. The function getVisitsInternal() has an if condition that checks if this.visits is null. In order to test the condition, we need to set this.visits to null so we can test the path 1->2. However without modifying the source code, it’s not possible to jump into the if branch. (view the branch [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/pet3.PNG))  When a pet object is created, the default value of visits is an empty set. (as seen [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/pet.PNG)) When trying to set it to null with setVisitInternal, it returns NullPointerException. The function being tested in Pet class needs to be reviewed and fixed. The severity of failure can be high because setting the default value as an empty set rather than null can add unnecessary memory cost. 

The function getVisit() doesn’t have any conditional branch that deriving CFG for it isn’t necessary. A noticeable line in the function is PropertyComparator.sort(sortedVisits). We test the sorting functionality with one success path and one failure path. 

The function addVisit(Visit visit) calls getVisitInternal() which returns the visits set and add the parameter visit. We sensitize the path with the inputs that will output the expected outputs. We confirm the output. 

### Model/PetType.java 
_(view the coverage [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/petType.PNG))_

### Model/Speciality.java

### Model/Vet.java 
_(view the coverage [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/vet.PNG))_

_(view the code [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/model/VetTests.java))_

*Unlike other test classes, the test for Vet.java was written in test/java/model instead of test/java/model. This is due to getSpecialtiesInternal() function which isn’t a public function but a protected function.   

The function getsSpecialtiesInternal() has an if branch. We set the coverage goal and derived the control flow graph.(see the graph [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/105.PNG)) As we expect the full coverage, we write test cases for each possible path. We test the first path 1->2 when the Set specialties is null. The function is similar to the one that caused failure coverage in the Pet class. Thus we again checked with a debugger. Contrast to the pet object (view [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/visitvspet2.PNG)), the vet object(view [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/visitVsPet1.PNG)) instantiation doesn’t set specialties as an empty set. The default value is null that it can jump into the condition. We cover all the paths and confirm with the code coverage tool.  
The function getSpecialities() doesn’t have any conditional branch that deriving CFG for it isn’t necessary. A noticeable line in the function is PropertyComparator.sort(sortedSpecs). We test the sorting functionality with one success path and one failure path.

The function addSpeciality(Speciality speciality) calls getSpecialtiesInternal() which returns the speciality set and add the parameter speciality. We sensitize the path with the inputs that will output the expected outputs. We confirm the output. 
The function getNrOfSpecialties simply tests the size of the specialities set. We manipulate the input, verify the output, confirm the coverage.

_(view the coverage [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/model/VetsTests.java))_

For the function getVetList(), we set the coverage goal and derived the control flow graph (view the graph [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/106.PNG)). We test each path(a path coverage) and confirm we see the expected output. Simultaneously we run the code coverage tool to verify that we covered every path.
As the code coverage result indicates, we see that our test cases fail to cover all the instructions/branches. The function getVetList() has an if condition that checks if the set vet is null. In order to test the condition, we need to make the set vet to null so we can test the path 1->2. However without modifying the source code, it’s not possible to jump into the if branch. (view the branch [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/vetssss.PNG))  When a newly created vets instance calls getVetList() function it calls the function on the set that’s a size 0. (as seen [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/visittt.PNG)) When trying to set it to null it returns NullPointerException. The class needs a setter that can possibly resolve the issue. The severity of failure can be high because setting the default value as an empty set rather than null can add unnecessary memory cost.

We couldn't sensitize the [path](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/unit-testing/wiki_images/cacheConfiguration2.PNG). We believe that it's an infeasible path that needs to be examined. The private function can't be reached from the test class.   

### Service/PetValidator.java

The function validate(Object obj, Error eros) has three if branches that we set the coverage goal and derived the control flow graph.(see the graph here) As we expect the full coverage, we write test cases for each possible path. We wrote a test case for each path.
