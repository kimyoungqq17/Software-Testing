# **Plan**

I will use Selenium to test the core functionality of PetClinic: adding owners and pets. 

# **Report** 

I used Selenium and chromedriver to add an owner with a specific first name, last name, address, city, and telephone number to the database. I proceeded to give this owner a pet with a name and a birthday. Finally, I searched for this owner (using their last name) and I tested to see if the parameters I entered for this owner and pet showed up. 

Since I used chromedriver and it is specific to my machine, I have not added my test to the "tests" folder. However, I have created a Google Drive to review my test code as well as the result of running the test (in the form of a video).
