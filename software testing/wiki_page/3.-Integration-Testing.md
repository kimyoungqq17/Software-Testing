# **Plan**

For integration testing, I will be running tests on the "persistence" and "model" layers. In particular, I will test the relationship between different entities in the model layer, and I will test how the different entities interact with the repositories in the persistence layer. 

# **Report**

**1. Provide a high-level block diagram of the overall architecture of the application.**.

**2. Visualize the dependencies between the different entities.**

As shown above, there are dependencies between _Vets_ and _Vet_, _Vet_ and _Speciality_, _Owner_ and _Pet_, _Pet_ and _PetType_, and _Pet_ and _Visit_. 

**3. Provide a description of your integration strategy (incl. justifications)**

I plan to complete integration testing using the _top-down_ approach. With this approach, less time is required to detect major faults and fault localization is easier. I will be using stubs as required for this approach to test dependencies between entities. 

**4. Document the list of all test cases (with links to the source files of the tests). Describe the goal,
input (if any) and the expected outcome of non-trivial test cases.**

My integration tests include: 
* Entity Dependence Tests: [OwnerPetDependencyTests.java](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/IntegrationTests/OwnerPetDependencyTests.java), [PetPetTypeDependencyTests.java](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/IntegrationTests/PetPetTypeDependencyTests.java), [PetVisitDependencyTests.java](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/IntegrationTests/PetVisitDependencyTests.java), [VetSpecialtyDependencyTests.java](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/IntegrationTests/VetSpecialtyDependencyTests.java), and [VetVetsDependencyTests.java](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/IntegrationTests/VetVetsDependencyTests.java) 
* Persistence Tests: [OwnerRepositoryIntegrationTests.java](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/OwnerRepositoryIntegrationTests.java), [PetRepositoryIntegrationTests.java](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/PetRepositoryIntegrationTests.java), [VetRepositoryIntegrationTests.java](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/VetRepositoryIntegrationTests.java), and [VisitRepositoryIntegrationTests.java](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/VisitRepositoryIntegrationTests.java). 



**5. Describe which drivers, mocks and stubs had to be created for your tests.**

Stubs were created for the entity dependence tests to "mock" the class that another class was dependent on as required for a top-down integration testing approach. 


**6. Describe any changes for instrumentation made to the source code of the application together
with its justification.**

I added a constructor and an addVet() method in order to test getVetList() when I was testing the dependency between Vet and Vets. 


**7. Document your coverage achieved after executing the integration tests (and the unit tests). How
did your integration test contribute to your coverage goals?**

Coverage went up to 80.4% after doing integration tests. Since coverage for unit tests was only 40.8%, 39.6% coverage was gained.
