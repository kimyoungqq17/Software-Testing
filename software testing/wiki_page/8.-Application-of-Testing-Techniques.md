### Stubs
We used stubs for integration testing when testing the entities in the "model" layer. This allowed us not to worry about dependencies when testing in a top-down manner. 

* **Document all the intermediate steps and models used when applying the technique** 

To set up the stubs, we used Mockito. For each stub, the @Mock notation was used.

* **Document the actual test cases derived by the testing technique**

Test cases which used stubs were written in following test classes: OwnerPetDependencyTests.java, PetPetTypeDependencyTests.java, PetVisitDependencyTests.java, VetSpecialtyDependencyTests.java, and VetVetsDependencyTests.java. The tests involved creating a stub for the class that a given class was dependent on and then in the case that a stub was needed to return a certain output from a function, the stub would be "set up" by using _Mockito.when_. 

* **Provide links to the actual source files of the test cases / test data using the particular technique**

The test files of the test cases using stubbing are linked below:

### Scenario graphs

For the acceptance testings, we used scenario graphs. This allows us to clearly devise a testing strategy that would cover the necessary functionality of the application that would we used by the users. We can thus cover the main path (what could happen in most cases), as well as the alternative and error paths, which some users could also encounter. See [Acceptance Testing Wiki Page](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/wiki/5.-Acceptance-Testing).
