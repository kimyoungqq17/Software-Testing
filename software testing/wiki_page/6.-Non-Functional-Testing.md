## Plan 

Our objective is to evaluate the performance and health of the PetClinic REST API service by measuring the runtime of a given API call and tracking CPU percent usage and Available Free Memory. Specifically, we will create a test driver program and make use of mocking technology to evaluate the following scenarios:

1. As the number of Owners increases, measure the time to {add | modify} one Owner.
1. As the number of Pets increases, measure the time to {add | modify} one Pet.

Generated performance data will be converted into charts. An analysis of the gathered data will be provided in the next section.

## Report

### Test Suite Description

Our test suite consists of a [TestDriver.java](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/NonFunctionalTests/TestDriver.java) program in which we make use of MockMvc to create test methods that add/modify Owner and Pet objects in the database. The TestDriver contains the following four test methods:

1. `testAddOwnerToDb` - to add Owner objects to the database
1. `testModifyOwnerInDb` - to modify Owner objects in the database
1. `testAddPetToDb` - to add Pet objects to the database
1. `testModifyPetInDb` - to modify Pet objects in the database

Our suite also contains a [LoadTest.java](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/NonFunctionalTests/LoadTest.java) file that makes use of [Zerocode](https://github.com/authorjapps/zerocode), an open-source library that allows for automated API testing. We have decided to use Zerocode since it allows us to load test API methods and efficiently evaluate the runtime of API calls as the number of objects in the database increases.

We configure load tests by setting up the [load_config.properties](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/src/main/resources/load_config.properties) file. As seen in the file, we have set up our load test to execute a total of 200 API calls, with each call being ramped up in a one-second gap. We have performed a load test for each of the four test methods found in the TestDriver program, and have stored the generated runtime data reports [in this folder](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/tree/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/NonFunctionalTests/performance-data/zerocode-reports). We use the `responseDelayMilliSec` column to generate the runtime charts found in the Runtime Analysis section.

To track CPU usage and Available Free Memory, we used [Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) and the [JMeter Perfmon plugin](https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/PerfMon/). JMeter allows for load testing API calls and the Perfmon plugin allows us to track performance metrics such as CPU usage and Available Free Memory while load tests are being performed, as seen [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/wiki_images/Non-Functional%20Testing%20Report%20Images/JMeter%20Perfmon%20Plugin%20Demo.PNG). We performed load tests on the following API calls (same calls that are being tested in the TestDriver.java program):

1. POST /owners/new
1. POST /owners/1/edit
1. POST /owners/1/pets/new
1. POST /owners/2/pets/1/edit

For reference, here is a [screenshot](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/wiki_images/Non-Functional%20Testing%20Report%20Images/JMeter%20POST%20Request%20Configuration.PNG) of the HTTP Request configuration in JMeter for the `POST /owners/new` API call. All other API calls follow the same configuration.

[Here is the configuration](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/blob/master/wiki_images/Non-Functional%20Testing%20Report%20Images/JMeter%20Thread%20Properties.PNG) for our load tests in JMeter. It is the same load test configuration that was used to measure runtime performance. The JMeter Perfmon plugin also automatically generates charts, which we have included in the CPU and Memory Analysis section.

#### Analysis of Chart Data

For runtime analysis, the result shown in the graphs seems to display stable and uniform performances. The maximum and minimum remain approximately the same and return at a periodical frequency across the whole graph. However, they seem to occur at random times, and not specifically during API calls.
When testing requests regarding the Owner class, the mean value for the graph representing the performance of modifying an Owner is higher than the one for adding an Owner (142.22 vs. 118.74). This difference is likely due to the fact that the API redirects to the user to the webpage of the owner for editing it, which implies that the owner must be found in the list of owners beforehand.
The same observation can be made about the graphs' performances regarding the Pet class, and also possibly for the same reason (182.55 vs. 192.685).
Furthermore, the graphs for API calls from the Owner class have a lower mean than the ones for the Pet class for the same operation (ex: add owner and add pet).  This difference is likely due to the fact that operations on the Pet object require an additional operation on the Owner object, which is to add Pet to the lists of Pets of the specified Owner.

#### Analysis of Chart Data

For the CPU performance, we can notice that there is no clear correlation between the API calls and the performance metrics of the CPU. This could indicate that the API operations have little to no impact on the CPU performance.
As for the available memory, the median for add Owner, modify Owner and add Pet is seen to be gradually decreasing (from 93.48 to 90.41 to  85.54), meaning that a noticeable part of memory is being used when performing the API calls. 


### Performance Risks Related to Runtime, CPU Usage, and Memory

For runtime of API calls, a response time of about 0.1 seconds offers users an “instant” response, with no interruption. A one-second response time is generally the maximum acceptable limit, as users still likely won’t notice a delay. Anything more than one second is problematic, and with a delay of around ten seconds, a user will typically leave the website or application entirely. In the non-functional testing, we have observed that the transaction time is between 1 and 2 seconds a bit less than half of the time. This will cause a bit of delay during the API calls, which slows down the navigation of the website. However, it is still acceptable by most users.

For CPU usage, normal CPU usage is 2-4% at idle, up to 70% for software operations, and up to 100% for more demanding tasks (such as rendering work). Higher percentages are more likely to affect the machine performance, such as slowing down the applications. During the API testing, the median for add Owner, modify Owner, add Pet and modify Pet were 5.367, 6.768, 9.339 and 4.87. This testing should thus not cause a problem for the performance of the CPU, as it is approximately using the percentage used when idle, most of the time.
For memory usage, usually a high percentage of RAM  could result in slow software operation. A 50% memory usage is considered to be normal and would not cause any performance issues, whereas a memory usage higher than 70% would likely slow down the performance. In this case, the percentage is around 90, which is above the threshold for performance quality.
