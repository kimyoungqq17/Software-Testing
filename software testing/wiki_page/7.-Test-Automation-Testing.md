## Design

The automated build incorporate the use of a code coverage tool, JaCoCo. (view the configuration [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE429-Fall2021/project-test-14/commit/5090e85e5f28680fcfc64b065f1d2664c45f4f23#diff-9c5fb3d1b7e3b0f54bc5c4182965c4fe1f9023d449017cece3005d3f90e8e4d8)) . Please note that because of the project's rules, there are failing tests in the project, which prevent the generation of Jacoco reports.

## Continuous Integration

The continuous integration is assured by Github Actions. They are used through the file [maven.yml](placeholder.com). The command `./mvnw --fail-never package` is used to run the tests. Since this project prevented us from fixing failing tests, we had to ignore them by using the --fail-never flag.
